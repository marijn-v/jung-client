## User stories

### For professionals

- As a user, I would like to have a quick overview of the events.
- As a user, I can sign up to make an account and log in. This way I can add events, e-mail my fans and view the venues.
- As a user, I can promote my event by adding it to agenda, with an image, date, link and a short description (max. 100 words).

### For audience:

- As a user, I would like to have quick overview of the events.
- As a user, I can sign up to make an account and log in. This way I can attend events and get updates from the promoter.

_This mvp is still a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised. Suggestions are welcome._

## Project board

Here you can find the [Github project kanban board](https://github.com/users/marijn-v/projects/1)

## Wireframe

Here you can find the [wireframes](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/jung-wireframe).
These wireframes where made at the beginning of the project. I used them troughout the project, but I ended up using the navigation bar as the menu, because there weren't that much options.

## Server repo

Here you can see the [back end server repo](https://github.com/marijn-v/jung-server)
